# Code Paste Bin

This is a simple code paste bin created after a friend and I were talking about it


# Setup

Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/HarryPotter12352/code-pastebin.git`. 
Make sure you have `express.js`, `mongoose`, `ejs`, and `body-parser` installed.
Now make a new file called `config.json` and in that enter content of the following format

```json
{"mongo_url": "mongo db url", "port": 5500}
```

Now run `node index` to start the project and enjoy!
